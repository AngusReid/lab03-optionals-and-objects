# Week 3 SimpleOptionals and Complex Objects

This file contains a summary of the information in lab03.html.  That file contains the lab 
instructions and should be opened in a browser so you can see all the images.

In this lab we will: 
* Practise using git
* Study _optionals_
* Implement a class defined by an interface
* Study the differences between copying references and values

Use this lab as an opportunity to practise small commits and good commit
messages. There are two parts to a commit message, the subject (around 50
characters) and the body. Like an email, the subject should be consise and
describe what's going on. For example:


	Fixed grammar and typos in introduction to user guide

	Apparently there are more exceptions to "'i' comes before 'e'" than
	there are words that follow it. Also, "'s"s are confusing.

From this example it's easy to get an idea as to what was being fixed. You can
see what your commits are by using `git log`. You should see something like:

	commit 97724c56ccc6239fb84b64a297a09f13720afbe8
	Author: Paul Crane <pscrane@gmail.com>
	Date:   Fri Jul 6 17:18:01 2018 +1300
	
	    Fixed grammar and typos in introduction to user guide

There are also all sorts of pretty printing options too, which you can look
into if you'd like. Have a look at [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
for some good guidelines.
